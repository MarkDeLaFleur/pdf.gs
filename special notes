After cloning the repo from PDF.js you have to initialize the node modules npm ci

In short, the main differences between using npm install and npm ci are:

The project must have an existing package-lock.json or npm-shrinkwrap.json.
If dependencies in the package lock do not match those in package.json, npm ci will exit with an error, instead of updating the package lock.
npm ci can only install entire projects at a time: individual dependencies cannot be added with this command.
If a node_modules is already present, it will be automatically removed before npm ci begins its install.
It will never write to package.json or any of the package-locks: installs are essentially frozen.

then I manually applied pdf.js.diff since I don't know what 'patch' was supposed to do as defined in the npm scripts section.
